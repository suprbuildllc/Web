  {
    question: 'How is pricing actually determined?',
    answer: 'The ranges above are starting points. Integrations, compliance requirements, and platform count are what move a quote — we confirm the real number after a short scoping call, in writing, before any work starts.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I start with Launch and move to Build later?',
    answer: 'Yes — Launch is designed to validate the product first. If it earns a bigger build, the codebase carries forward into a Build engagement instead of starting over.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What exactly does the Embedded Team plan include?',
    answer: 'A dedicated senior engineer and project manager working inside your roadmap on a monthly retainer — weekly sprints, direct Slack access, and infra/on-call coverage. It\'s built for products that need continuous iteration, not a one-off build.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you ever bill hourly?',
    answer: 'Fixed-scope work is priced and billed as a fixed amount, not hours — it protects your budget from scope drift. The Embedded Team plan is a flat monthly retainer rather than hourly billing too.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is the AI voice assistant something we can buy?',
    answer: 'No — it\'s not a product we sell. It\'s how our own support and sales run, built by our AI agent systems team. If you want something similar built for your business, that falls under our AI agent systems service.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Who owns the code and IP after launch?',
    answer: 'You do, fully, on delivery — source code, infrastructure configs, and design files. There\'s no lock-in to keep working with us.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you sign NDAs and handle compliance needs?',
    answer: 'Yes to NDAs before any scoping call. For regulated builds we design around the relevant compliance requirements from day one rather than retrofitting them later.'
